version 2.1.1
-------------
- Updated XMPPSend 'presence', 'message' and 'iq' methods to accept $jaxl instance as first parameter
  if you are not calling these methods directly from your application code as mentioned in documentation
  this change should not hurt you 
- Added more comments to env/jaxl.ini and also added JAXL_LOG_ROTATE ini file option
- JAXL instance logs can be rotated every x seconds (logRotate config parameter) now
- Removed config param dumpTime, instead use dumpStat to specify stats dump period
- Base XMPP class now auto-flush output buffers filled because of library level rate limiter
- Added more options for JAXL constructor e.g.
  boshHost, boshPort, boshSuffix, pidPath, logPath, logLevel, dumpStat, dumpTime
  These param overwrites value specified inside jaxl.ini file
  Also JAXL core will now periodically dump instance statistics 
- Added an option in JAXL constructor to disable inbuild core rate limiter 
- Added support when applications need to connect with external bosh endpoints
  Bosh application code requires update for ->JAXL0206('startStream') method 
- XMPPGet::handler replaces ->handler inside XEP-0124
- JAXLCron job now also passes connected  instance to callback cron methods 
- Updated base XMPP class now maintains a clock, updated sendXML method to respect library level rate limiting
- Base JAXL class now includes JAXLCron class for periodically dumping connected bot memory/usage stats
- First version of JAXLCron class for adding periodic jobs in the background
- XMPP payload handler moves from XMPPGet to base XMPP class, packets are then routed to XMPPGet class for further processing
- Updated xep-0124 to use instance bosh parameters instead of values defined inside jaxl.ini 
- Provision to specify custom JAXL_BOSH_HOST inside jaxl.ini 
- Instead of global logLevel and logPath, logger class now respects indivisual instance log settings
  Helpful in multiple instance applications 
- Updated base JAXL class to accept various other configuration parameters inside constructor
  These param overwrites values defined inside jaxl.ini 
- XMPPSend::xml method moves inside XMPP::sendXML (call using ->sendXML from within application code), as a part of library core cleanup
- Updated jaxl class to return back payload from called xep methods
- XMPP base method getXML can be instructed not to take a nap between stream reads
- Added jaxl_get_xml hook for taking control over incoming xml payload from xmpp stream
- Added support for disabling sig term registration, required by applications who already handle this in their core code
- Added capability of sending multiple message/presence stanza in one go inside jaxl base class
- Fixed typo in MUC Direct Invitation xep invite method
- getHandler should have accepted core instance by reference, fixed now. BOSH MUC Chat sample application header is now more appropriate

version 2.1.0
-------------
- First checkin of bosh MUC sample application 
- Updated build file now packages bosh MUC chat sample application along with core classes 
- Updated JAXLog class to accept  instance inside log() method, application code should use ->log() to call JAXLog::log() method now 
- Updated JAXLPlugin class to pass  instance along with every XMPP event hook 
- Updated jaxl_require method to call including XEP's init() method every time they are included using jaxl_require method

- Updated echobot sample application code to pass  instance while calling jaxl_require method 
- Update XMPP SASL Auth class to accept  instance while calculating SASL response.
  Also passinginstance when jaxl_get_facebook_key hook is called 
- Updated XMPP base class to accept component host name inside constructor.
  Sending currentinstance with every XMPPSend, XMPPGet and JAXLog method calls 
- Every XMPPGet method now accepts instance.
  Updated JAXLPlugin execute method call to accept instance and also passing current working instance to JAXLog method calls 
- Every XMPPSend method now accepts instance.
  Updated JAXLPlugin execute method call to accept instance and also passing current working  instance to JAXLog method calls 
- Updated component bot sample application to show how to pass component host inside JAXL constructor.
  Also updated jaxl_require call to accept current working  instance 
- Updated boshchat sample application to follow new rules of jaxl_require, also cleaned up the sample app code a bit 
- Updated jaxl.ini of packaged sample applications to match /env/jaxl.ini 
- Updated implemented XEP's init method to accept instance during initialization step
  Send working instance with every XMPPSend method call
  Almost every XEP's available method now accepts an additional instance so that XEP's can work independently for every  instance inside a multiple jaxl instance application code 
- Added magic method __call inside JAXL class
  All application codes should now call a methods inside implemented XEP's like ->JAXLxxxx('method', , , ...)
  Also added ->log method to be used by application codes
  JAXLog::log() should not be called directly from application code
  Updated XMPPSend methods to accept instance
  Added ->requires() method that does a similar job as jaxl_require() which now also expects  instance as one of the passed parameter.
